# Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models

## Libraries

Libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform many actions without writing the code

1. Scientifics computing libraries
   1. Pandas. Python data structure and tools
   2. Numpy. Arrays and matrices
2. Visualization
   1. Matplotlib. Plots and graphs
   2. Seaborn. Plots: heat maps, time series, violin plots
3. Machine learning and deep learning
   1. Scikit-learn. Regression, classification, clustering
   2. Keras. Deep learning neural networks
   3. TensorFlow. Deep learning: Production and Deployment
4. PyTorch. Deep learning: regression, classification
5. ApacheSpark. General purpose cluster-computing framework
6. Scala. There are many libraries for data engineering and data science.
   1. Vegas. Statistical data visualizations
   2. Big DL for deep learning
7. R. Some complementary libraries
   1. ggplot2. data visualization


## Aplication programming interface

An API, allows communication between two pieces of software. It is like a waiter at a restaurant. It takes your request (like ordering food), communicates it to the kitchen (the application), and then brings you the response (your meal). In the world of software, APIs allow different applications to talk to each other and share data, making it possible for services like ride-sharing apps, online payments, and smart thermostats to work seamlessly.

REST APIs allow you to communicate through the internet and take advantage of resources like storage, data, artificially, intelligent algorithms, and much more


## Data Sets

A data set is a structured collection of data.

Data embodies information represented as text, numbers or media such as images, audio or videos

A tabular data set comprises a collection of rows containing columns that store de information. One popular tabular data format is **"comma separated values"** or **csv**.
   
Over time, many public and private entities such as scientific institutions, governments, organizationgs, and even companies have started making data sets available to the public as "open data".

### Dataset licenses

When you select a dataset, it is necessary to look into the license. A license explains whether you can use that dataset or not; or explains if you have to accept certain guidelines to use that dataset. The different license types are listed below.

**PUBLIC DOMAIN MARK - PUBLIC DOMAIN**
When a dataset has a Public Domain license, all the rights to use, access, modify and share the dataset are open to everyone. Here there is technically no license.

**OPEN DATA COMMONS PUBLIC DOMAIN DEDICATION AND LICENSE – PDDL**
Open Data Commons license has the same features as the Public Domain license, but the difference is the PDDL license uses a licensing mechanism to give the rights to the dataset.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION 4.0 INTERNATIONAL CC-BY**
This license allows users to share and modify a dataset, but only if they give credit to the creator(s) of the dataset.

**COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA PERMISSIVE-2.0**
Like most open-source licenses, this license allows users to use, modify, adapt, and share the dataset, but only if a disclaimer of warranties and liability is also included.

**OPEN DATA COMMONS ATTRIBUTION LICENSE - ODC-BY**
This license allows users to share and adapt a dataset, but only if they give credit to the creator(s) of the dataset.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC-BY-SA**
This license allows users to use, share, and adapt a dataset, but only if they give credit to the dataset and show any changes or transformations, they made to the dataset. Users might not want to use this license because they have to share the work they did on the dataset.

**COMMUNITY DATA LICENSE AGREEMENT – CDLA-SHARING-1.0**
This license uses the principle of ‘copyleft’: users can use, modify, and adapt a dataset, but only if they don’t add license restrictions on the new work(s) they create with the dataset.

**OPEN DATA COMMONS OPEN DATABASE LICENSE - ODC-ODBL**
This license allows users to use, share, and adapt a dataset but only if they give credit to the dataset and show any changes or transformations they make to the dataset. Users might not want to use this license because they have to share the work they did on the dataset.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC**
This license is a restrictive license. Users can share and adapt a dataset, provided they give credit to its creator(s) and ensure that the dataset is not used for any commercial purpose.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NO DERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-ND**
This license is also a restrictive license. Users can share a dataset if they give credit to its creator(s). This license does not allow additions, transformations, or changes to the dataset.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC-SA**
This license allows users to share a dataset only if they give credit to its creator(s). Users can share additions, transformations, or changes to the dataset, but they cannot use the dataset for commercial purposes.

**CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL - CC BY-NC-ND**
This license allows users to share a dataset only if they give credit to its creator(s). Users are not allowed to modify the dataset and are not allowed to use it for commercial purposes.
