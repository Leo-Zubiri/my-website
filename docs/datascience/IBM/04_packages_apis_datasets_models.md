# Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models

## Libraries

Libraries are a collection of functions and methods that allow you to perform many actions without writing the code

1. Scientifics computing libraries
   1. Pandas. Python data structure and tools
   2. Numpy. Arrays and matrices
2. Visualization
   1. Matplotlib. Plots and graphs
   2. Seaborn. Plots: heat maps, time series, violin plots
3. Machine learning and deep learning
   1. Scikit-learn. Regression, classification, clustering
   2. Keras. Deep learning neural networks
   3. TensorFlow. Deep learning: Production and Deployment
4. PyTorch. Deep learning: regression, classification
5. ApacheSpark. General purpose cluster-computing framework
6. Scala. There are many libraries for data engineering and data science.
   1. Vegas. Statistical data visualizations
   2. Big DL for deep learning
7. R. Some complementary libraries
   1. ggplot2. data visualization


## Aplication programming interface

An API, allows communication between two pieces of software. It is like a waiter at a restaurant. It takes your request (like ordering food), communicates it to the kitchen (the application), and then brings you the response (your meal). In the world of software, APIs allow different applications to talk to each other and share data, making it possible for services like ride-sharing apps, online payments, and smart thermostats to work seamlessly.

REST APIs allow you to communicate through the internet and take advantage of resources like storage, data, artificially, intelligent algorithms, and much more


## Data Sets

A data set is a structured collection of data.

Data embodies information represented as text, numbers or media such as images, audio or videos

A tabular data set comprises a collection of rows containing columns that store de information. One popular tabular data format is **"comma separated values"** or **csv**.
   
Over time, many public and private entities such as scientific institutions, governments, organizationgs, and even companies have started making data sets available to the public as "open data".
