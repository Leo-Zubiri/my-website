# From Deployment to feedback

Once a model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test

> Depending on the purpose of the model, it may be rolled out to a limited group of users or in a test environment, to build up confidence in applying the outcome for use across the board

Once in play, feedback from the users will help to refine the model and assess it for performance and impact.

> The value of the model will be dependent on successfully incorporating feedback and making adjusments for as long as the solution is required

Redeployment. Continue modeling, deployment, feedback, and refinement throughout the life of the intervention program

- Stakeholders, including the solution owner, marketing staff, application developers, and IT administration evaluate the model and contribute feedback.
- During the Deployment stage, data scientists release the data model to a targeted group of stakeholders.
- Stakeholder and user feedback help assess the model's performance and impact during the Feedback stage.
- The model's value depends on iteration; that is, how successfully the data model incorporates user feedback

# Summary

## From problem to approach

Thinking like a data scientist

- Forming a concrete business or research problem
- Collecting and analyzing data
- Building a model
- Understanding the feedback after model deployment

## To working with the data

- Determining the data requirements
- Collecting the appropriate data
- Understanding the data
- Preparing the data for modeling

## To deriving the answer

- Once the analytic approach is selected, to derive the answer:
  - Evaluating and deploying the model
  - Getting feedback on it
  - Using that feedback constructively so as to improve the model

> all this stages are iterative

## Answering the following main questions

The data science methodology aims to answer the following 10 questions in this precribed sequence

**From problem to approach**

- What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
- How can you use data to answer the question

**Working with de data**

- What data do you need to answer the question?
- Where is the data coming from (identify all sources), and how will you get it?
- Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
- What additional work is required to manipulate and work with the data?

**Deriving the answer**

- In what way you can the data be visualized to get to the answer that is required?
- Does the model used really answer the initial question, or does it need to be adjusted?
- Can you put the model into practice?
- Can you getr constructive feedback into answering the question?
