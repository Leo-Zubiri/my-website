# What is Data Science

- Data Science is the process of using data to understand different things. 
- When you translate data into a story to generate insight then you can make strategic choices for a company or institution
- The study of data to understand the world

> Data -> Stories -> insights

Data analysis isn't new. What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources:

- Log files
- Email
- Social media
- Sales data
- Patient information files
- Sports performance data
- Sensor data
- Security cameras
- Many more besides

**Can help organizations**

- Understand their environments
- Analyze existing issues
- Reveal previously hidden opportunities

> The good **data scientists** are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need.
> - What data do we need to solve the problem?
> - Where will that data come from?

**An exceptional data acientist**
Its a blend of
- Curiosity
- Computer scientist
- Software engineer
- Statistician
- Storytelling

**The process of gleaning isights from data**

- Clarify the problem
- Data collection
- Analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Storytelling
- Visualization


**Glossary**

- **Algorithms**  A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task. 	
- **Model**  A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis. 	
- **Outliers** 	When a data point or points occur significantly outside of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modeling. 
- **Quantitative analysis**	A systematic approach using mathematical and statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data. 	Many Paths to Data Science
**Structured data** Data is organized and formatted into a predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns.
- **Unstructured data**  Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes text, images, videos, and other content that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data.

## Regression

Regression data analysis is a statistical method that examines the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those correlations are statistically significant or not. 

**Example**: we can say that age and height can be described using a linear regression model. Since a person's height increases as age increases, they have a linear relationship

## Cloud

Delivery of on-demand computing resources
- Networks
- Servers
- Storage
- Applications
- Services
- Data centers
Over the Internet on a pay-for-use basis

### What is Cloud computing

Applications and data that users access over the Internet rather than locally
- Online web apps
- Secure online business applications
- Storing personal files
  - Google drive
  - OneDrive
  - Dropbox

**Benefits**
- No need to purchase applications and install them on local computer
- Use online versions and pay a monthly subscription
- More cost-effective
- Access most current software versions
- Save local storage space
- Work collaboratively in real time

**Essential characteristics**
- on-demand self-service
- broad network access
- resource pooling
- rapid elasticity
- meseaured service

**Deployment models**
- public
- private
- hybrid

**Cloud Service models**
- **IaaS**. Infrastructure as a Service. You can access the infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space without the need to manage or operate them.
- **PaaS**. Platform as a Service. You can access the platform that comprises the hardware and software tools that are usually needed to develop and deploy applications to users over the internet
- **SaaS**. Software as a Service. Software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis.
