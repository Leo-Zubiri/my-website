# What is Data Science

- Data Science is the process of using data to understand different things. 
- When you translate data into a story to generate insight then you can make strategic choices for a company or institution

Data analysis isn't new. What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources:

- Log files
- Email
- Social media
- Sales data
- Patient information files
- Sports performance data
- Sensor data
- Security cameras
- Many more besides

**Can help organizations**

- Understand their environments
- Analyze existing issues
- Reveal previously hidden opportunities

> The good **data scientists** are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need.
> - What data do we need to solve the problem?
> - Where will that data come from?
