# What is Data Science

- Data Science is the process of using data to understand different things. 
- When you translate data into a story to generate insight then you can make strategic choices for a company or institution
- The study of data to understand the world

> Data -> Stories -> insights

Data analysis isn't new. What is new is the vast quantity of data available from massively varied sources:

- Log files
- Email
- Social media
- Sales data
- Patient information files
- Sports performance data
- Sensor data
- Security cameras
- Many more besides

**Can help organizations**

- Understand their environments
- Analyze existing issues
- Reveal previously hidden opportunities

> The good **data scientists** are curious people who ask questions to clarify the business need.
> - What data do we need to solve the problem?
> - Where will that data come from?

**An exceptional data acientist**
Its a blend of
- Curiosity
- Computer scientist
- Software engineer
- Statistician
- Storytelling

**The process of gleaning isights from data**

- Clarify the problem
- Data collection
- Analysis
- Pattern recognition
- Storytelling
- Visualization


**Glossary**

- **Algorithms**  A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a problem or complete a task. 	
- **Model**  A representation of the relationships and patterns found in data to make predictions or analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis. 	
- **Outliers** 	When a data point or points occur significantly outside of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modeling. 
- **Quantitative analysis**	A systematic approach using mathematical and statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data. 	Many Paths to Data Science
**Structured data** Data is organized and formatted into a predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns.
- **Unstructured data**  Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes text, images, videos, and other content that doesn’t fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data.

## Regression

Regression data analysis is a statistical method that examines the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables
Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those correlations are statistically significant or not. 

**Example**: we can say that age and height can be described using a linear regression model. Since a person's height increases as age increases, they have a linear relationship
