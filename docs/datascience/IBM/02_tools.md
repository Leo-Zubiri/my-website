# Tools for Data Science

Before it can be useful, raw data must pass through **The Data Science Task categories**

- **Data Management.** Data is collected from many sources, retrieving data securely, efficiently and cost-effectively
- **Data Integration and Transformation.** Extract, Transform and Load data (ETL). Extract the data and save it in a central repository (data warehouse), transforming the values, structure and format of the data. Transformed data is loaded back to the data warehouse.
- **Data Visualization.** Graphical representation of data and information (charts, plots, maps and animations)
- **Model Building.** It is the step where you train the data and analyze patterns using suitable machine learning algorithms
- **Model Deployment.** Integrating a model into a production environment. Uses API's to enable data-based decisions
- **Model Monitoring and Assessment.** Run continuous quality checks to ensure a model's accuracy, fairness and robustness
