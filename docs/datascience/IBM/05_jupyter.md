# Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebooks originated as **iPython**, originally for python programming. Actually, Jupyter stands for Julia, Python, R and many other languages

A Jupyter Notebook is a browser based application that allows you to create and share documents containing code, equations, visualizations, narrative text links and more. It is like a scientist's lab notebook where a scientist records all step to perform their experiments and the results they can reproduce.

A Jupyter notebook file allows you to combine descriptive text, code blocks, and code output in a single file. Finally you can export the notebook to a PDF, HTML file format to share with anyone.

## Jupyter Lab

It's a browser based application that allows you to access multiple jupyter notebooks files, other code, and data files. In addtion, it extends the functionalities of Jupyter Notebooks by enabling you to work with multiple notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

Jupyter Notebooks can be used with cloud based services like IBM and Google Colab.

> **Anaconda** is one of the popular distribution which includes Jupyter and Jupyter Lab, locally.


## Jupyter Kernels

A Kernel is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a Notebook file.

When a notebook document opens, the related kernel launches automatically, the kernel performs the computation and produce the results.

Depending on your settings you may need to install other notebooks languages in the jupyter environments.
