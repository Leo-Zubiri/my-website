> - Not knowing how to apply the data to resolve the business problem correctly

A methodology is: 

- A system of methods
- A guideline for decision-making during the scientific process

**Data science methodology questions**

1. Define the issue and approach
   1. What is the problem that you are trying to solve?
   2. How can you use data to answer the business question?
2. Get organized around the data
   1. What data do you need to answer the question
