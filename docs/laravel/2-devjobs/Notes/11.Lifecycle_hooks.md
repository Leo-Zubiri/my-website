Each Livewire component undergoes a lifecycle. Lifecycle hooks allow you to run code at any part of the component's lifecyle, or before specific properties are updated.

Runs once, immediately after the component is instantiated, but before render() is called. This is only called once on initial page load and never called again, even on component refreshes
