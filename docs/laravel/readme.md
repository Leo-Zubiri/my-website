Laravel is an open-source PHP framework, which is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern.

Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching. Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality.
